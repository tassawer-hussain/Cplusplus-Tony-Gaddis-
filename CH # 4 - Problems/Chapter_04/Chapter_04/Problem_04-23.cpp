/*
	23. Internet Service Provider
	An Internet service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:

	Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hours
	are $2.00 per hour.

	Package B: For $14.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours
	are $1.00 per hour.

	Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.

	Write a program that calculates a customerï¿½s monthly bill. It should ask which package
	the customer has purchased and how many hours were used. It should then display
	the total amount due.
	Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C. Also, the number
	of hours used in a month cannot exceed 744.
