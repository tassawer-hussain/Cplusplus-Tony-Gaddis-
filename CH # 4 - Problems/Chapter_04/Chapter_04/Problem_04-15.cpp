/*
	15. Personal Best
	Write a program that asks for the name of a pole vaulter and the dates and vault
	heights (in meters) of the athleteï¿½s three best vaults. It should then report, in order of
	height (best first), the date on which each vault was made and its height.
	
	Input Validation: Only accept values between 2.0 and 5.0 for the heights.
